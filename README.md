## _E-Commerce Management System_

E-commerce System provides an easy way to sell products to a large customer base. When users land on a e-commerce site, they expect to find 
what they are looking for quickly and easily. Also, users are not sure about the brands or the actual products they want to purchase. They have 
a very broad idea about what they want to buy. The purpose of any e-commerce website is to help customers narrow down their broad ideas 
and enable them to finalize the products they want to purchase.
